00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.180 line:0
Keystone species are those that play a unique and crucial role in ecosystem

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.810 line:0
function.

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:15.310 line:0
They have a disproportionately large effect on their environment relative to their

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.170 line:0
abundance.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.770 line:0
Because of their key role in maintaining biodiversity,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.700 line:0
efforts to manage and protect keystone species can help stabilize the entire

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.139 line:0
biological community.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.379 line:0
The term Keystone species was first coined by Doctor Robert Payne in

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:32.909 line:0
1969.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.049 line:0
His research found that the purple sea star prevented mussels from

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:41.669 line:0
overpopulating rocky intertidal ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest.

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:46.700
There are 5 generally recognized categories of keystone species,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.430
keystone predators,

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:49.619
modifiers,

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.590
prey,

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:51.590
mutualists,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.500
and hosts.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.689 line:0
If a keystone predator like the gray wolf is removed from the ecosystem,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.599 line:0
populations of their prey,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.520 line:0
such as elk,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.209 line:0
exponentially increase.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.410 line:0
This can cause a cascading effect on other plants and animals within the ecosystem.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.650 line:0
By preying on mussels that would otherwise dominate the ecosystem,

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:17.660 line:0
the purple sea star is a keystone predator that opens up habitat for a diversity of

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.809 line:0
other species.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.739 line:0
Another keystone predator is the American alligator found in the southeastern US.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.519 line:0
Alligators prey on fish,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.550 line:0
amphibians,

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:28.389 line:0
reptiles,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.790 line:0
birds,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.029 line:0
and mammals.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.339 line:0
The alligator is also an example of a keystone modifier,

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:35.220 line:0
or ecosystem engineer,

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.819 line:0
which creates or significantly modifies its habitat.

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:43.019 line:0
Alligators dig depressions in the ground that fill with deeper water,

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:47.699 line:0
providing refuge for fish and other aquatic species during the dry season.

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:52.349 line:0
Another keystone modifier is the black-tailed prairie dog,

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:57.400 line:0
which keeps grasslands and the great plains properly maintained with a diversity of plants

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.309 line:0
that benefit other grazing species such as cattle and pronghorn.

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:07.169 line:0
Prairie dog burrows aerate compacted soil and allow water to penetrate deeper into

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.989 line:0
the ground.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.990 line:0
Many other species use the burrows for shelter.

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:15.080 line:0
Prairie dogs are also an important food source for coyotes,

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:15.910 line:0
foxes,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.559 line:0
hawks,

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.679 line:0
and the endangered black-footed ferret.

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:21.699 line:0
That brings us to the next category,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.089 line:0
keystone prey,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.729 line:0
which can cause significant fluctuations in predator densities.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.470 line:0
Pacific salmon are keystone prey,

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.460 line:0
playing a vital role in Pacific Northwest ecosystems and directly benefiting

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.690 line:0
89 birds,

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.619 line:0
41 mammals.

00:02:37.154 --> 00:02:41.904 line:0
5 reptiles and 2 amphibians through ecosystem nutrient loading.

00:02:42.914 --> 00:02:47.875 line:0
The black-bellied salamander is another keystone prey species that provides a large amount of

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:52.274 line:0
protein biomass for predators in certain stream ecosystems in the

00:02:52.274 --> 00:02:53.585 line:0
southeastern US.

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:59.320 line:0
Keystone mutualists are those organisms that participate in mutually beneficial

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.320 line:0
interactions,

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:01.250 line:0
with hummingbirds,

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:03.220 line:0
the most notable examples.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.229 line:0
Otherwise known as link species,

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:10.270 line:0
many hummingbirds pollinate highly specialized plants that have adapted to pollination

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.000 line:0
only by these birds.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.259 line:0
The last category is the Keystone host,

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.860 line:0
with the quaking aspen being one example.

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:22.860 line:0
Aspens create an open canopy that harbors diversity on the forest floor,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.960 line:0
attracting many insects not found elsewhere within the ecosystem.

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:27.910 line:0
In addition,

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:29.660 line:0
the red-naped sapsucker,

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.259 line:0
a keystone modifier,

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.110 line:0
excavates its nest in aspen trees.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.110 line:0
The abandoned nests provides shelter for many other bird species.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.660 line:0
The greater biodiversity that Keystone species help maintain affords

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.100 line:0
protection of water resources and soil,

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.369 line:0
nutrient storage and recycling,

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.740 line:0
pollution control,

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:53.619 line:0
and better recovery from unpredictable environmental events.
